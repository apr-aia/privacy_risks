# Assessing Privacy Risks of Attribute Inference Attacks against Speech-based Depression Detection System

# ðŸ“„ This is the official GitHub Repo for the paper: [Assessing Privacy Risks of Attribute Inference Attacks against Speech-based Depression Detection System](ecai_attribute_attack.pdf) .

## Datasets

Different datasets were used for this work:

* [Androids Depression Corpus](https://github.com/androidscorpus/data?tab=readme-ov-file) to train the target model and white-box attackers. We did further preprocessing for the data, such as segmentation. You can download the segmented audio files from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pyno24ypl5g3n0c56dec1/segmentation.zip?rlkey=j1zsqoa3r381yo0ik4gyus0qs&st=hwbzvf88&dl=0) , and the text transcription from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/giymtkphvgq5eds88bmph/text-transcription.zip?rlkey=bapiuy4gh07zxa9enwackrpyt&st=oxp3kak6&dl=0) .
* Common Voice Mozilla in [English and Italy](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) to train the black box attacker models. Here are the names of the audio recordings that were used in [English](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4owx5impep0tccwtut805/english.zip?rlkey=y4s7kjlu5lzdmkxoac731wz4u&st=q0hkslop&dl=0) and [Italian](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gdatoaw3f30cjb6fggg0u/italy.zip?rlkey=2qnvzbeqwn3z08va5acivt7wj&st=wdpobzs0&dl=0) languages.
