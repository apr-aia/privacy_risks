# Assessing Privacy Risks of Attribute Inference Attacks against Speech-based Depression Detection System

## Overview

This is the official GitHub Repo for the paper _Assessing Privacy Risks of Attribute Inference Attacks against Speech-based Depression Detection System_. 

## Datasets
Different datasets used for this work:
 * [Androids Depression Corpus](https://github.com/androidscorpus/data?tab=readme-ov-file) to train the target model and white box attackers. We did further preporcessing for the data, such as:
       *Segmentation
   
 * Common voice mozilla in [English and Italy](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) to train the attacker models. Here is the the name of audio recording that is been used in [English]() and [Italian]() languges.
