# Assessing Privacy Risks of Attribute Inference Attacks against Speech-based Depression Detection System

This is the official GitHub Repo for the paper _Assessing Privacy Risks of Attribute Inference Attacks against Speech-based Depression Detection System_. 

## Datasets

Different datasets were used for this work:

* [Androids Depression Corpus](https://github.com/androidscorpus/data?tab=readme-ov-file) to train the target model and white-box attackers. We did further preprocessing for the data, such as segmentation. You can download the segmented audio files from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/pyno24ypl5g3n0c56dec1/segmentation.zip?rlkey=j1zsqoa3r381yo0ik4gyus0qs&st=hwbzvf88&dl=0) , and the text transcription form [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/giymtkphvgq5eds88bmph/text-transcription.zip?rlkey=bapiuy4gh07zxa9enwackrpyt&st=oxp3kak6&dl=0) .
* Common Voice Mozilla in [English and Italy](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) to train the attacker models. Here are the names of the audio recordings that were used in [English](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/v3z9vq05tmrteg19fupd3/english.csv?rlkey=gcqdkz0yza1xzyyzlse1sf3sw&st=ylb2838j&dl=0) and [Italian](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/d1mtcftxrysgrzu8884ks/italy.csv?rlkey=olndoszqiseh3xht6j5gau6l2&st=ltvskx7s&dl=0) languages.
